This repository contains various scripts and programs I have created that I
wish to share with the world and are too small to fit in any other repository.
Please see the LICENSE.txt file for licensing/legal information.

Brief descriptions of some of the contents:

* `private-r800.xml` - this is for using the Logitech Presenter R800 tool with
  [Karabiner](https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/). See [this blog
  post](http://www.andrewferrier.com/blog/2015/09/16/getting-logitech-presenter-r800-working-with-quicktime-player-on-mac/)
  for more information.

* `docker-copy-as-user` - for copying files into Dockerfiles owned by
  particular users. See [this blog
  post](http://www.andrewferrier.com/blog/2015/09/18/working-around-docker-copy-as-root/) for more
  information.

(for anyone looking for git-refresh-from-remote, it has moved to
[git-utilities](https://github.com/andrewferrier/git-utilities))

(for anyone looking for rename-phone-files, I now provide this functionality
in [normalize-filename](https://github.com/andrewferrier/normalize-filename)
instead.)
