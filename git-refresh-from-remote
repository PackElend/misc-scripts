#!/bin/sh
#
# This script will update a subdirectory within a git checkout directory (aka
# the parent repository), which contains the contents of another git
# repository (aka the child repository). It will create a single commit to
# bring the parent's subdirectory up-to-date with the current contents of the
# child repository, with a commit comment which contains the short hash of the
# latest commit from the child (if there are no changes, a commit is not
# created).
#
# This script can therefore be considered as a lightweight way of
# representing, and keeping up-to-date, the contents of a child repository
# within a parent, without explicit use of git-submodule.
#
# The script tries to be "safe" by creating a stash first for any local
# changes in the parent repository, and restoring it at the end.
#
# Note that git history from the child repository is not accurately
# represented in the parent repository - commits from the child repo between
# the last time this command was called, and this one, are ignored, apart from
# the very latest.
#
# Example usage:
#
# git-refresh-from-remote ~/local-git-checkout/repositoryX http://remote.host/repositoryX
#
# Possible future enhancements:
#
# * Support --no-commit, like other git commands.
# * Support complete representation of child history in parent.
# * Clarify process/message printed when adding child repo for the first time.
